 My IM App
 
 This is my first Android App, first JAVA App, first mysql app, first PHP program, and so on. 
 It is an instant messenger app. Work well when I set up the server on my local desktop.
 
 This App is bad organized and bad commented. Update soon after this semester.
 
 Mechanism:
 1. all features related to database is based on HTTP request. Server use php file to receive http request and control mysql.
 2. all chat features based on socket. Android side connect server (a java program) based on socket.
