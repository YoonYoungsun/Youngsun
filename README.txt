 My Android Instant Messenger App
 
 This is my first Android App. 
 It is an instant messenger. Work well when I set up the server on my local desktop using XAMPP.
 
 This App is bad organized and bad commented, basically for created for learning. You can see there are code snippets
 I copied and modified from tutorials and examples.
 
 Mechanism:
 1. all features related to database is based on HTTP request. Server use php file to receive http request and control mysql.
 2. all chat features based on socket. Android side connect server (a java program) based on socket.
